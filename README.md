# File-Compressor-and-Decompressor
Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm ideal for text files. It assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, leading to efficient compression. This can result in up to 30-40% data compression, saving significant storage space and bandwidth, especially beneficial for cloud storage and sharing. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the frequency variation of different characters in the data.

#Use
File compression tools make large files smaller. This helps in sending big files via email, saving space on your computer, and sharing files faster. They can also group many files into one, making it easier to organize and share. The effectiveness can vary based on the type of file.
