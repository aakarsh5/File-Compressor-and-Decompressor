# File-Compressor-and-Decompressor
Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm ideal for text files. It assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, leading to efficient compression. This can result in up to 30-40% data compression, saving significant storage space and bandwidth, especially beneficial for cloud storage and sharing. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the frequency variation of different characters in the data.

# Use
File compression tools make large files smaller. This helps in sending big files via email, saving space on your computer, and sharing files faster. They can also group many files into one, making it easier to organize and share. The effectiveness can vary based on the type of file.

# Huffman Coding Algorithm
Huffman coding is a clever method for compressing data by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less common ones. Here's how it works step by step:

## 1.Character Frequency Analysis:
We start by analyzing the input data to determine the frequency of each character. This helps us understand which characters are more common and which ones are rare.

## 2.Building the Huffman Tree:
With the frequency data in hand, we construct a binary tree known as the Huffman tree. Starting with individual characters as leaf nodes, we merge pairs of nodes with the lowest frequencies until we have a single root node. This process ensures that characters with higher frequencies are closer to the root, resulting in shorter paths and shorter binary codes.

## 3.Assigning Binary Codes: 
Once the Huffman tree is built, we traverse it to assign binary codes to each character. As we traverse the tree, we assign '0' for left branches and '1' for right branches. This process guarantees that each character has a unique binary code, with shorter codes for more common characters and longer codes for less common ones.

## 4.Encoding and Decoding: 
With the Huffman tree and binary codes established, we can encode our input data by replacing each character with its corresponding binary code. This compressed representation of the data can be efficiently stored or transmitted. To decode the compressed data, we traverse the Huffman tree using the encoded binary stream, reconstructing the original input data.
