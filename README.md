Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm ideal for text files. It assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, leading to efficient compression. This can result in up to 30-40% data compression, saving significant storage space and bandwidth, especially beneficial for cloud storage and sharing. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the frequency variation of different characters in the data.
